A blockchain roulette casino game. Can you beat your hi-score?

## Try it out!

You'll need to authenticate with a blockstack account (an open-source blockchain framework for building decentralized apps and smart contracts) in order to track your score.

Scores are saved and preserved on blockstack distributed data storage. Each time the hi-score is updated, the score gets posted back on the underlying blockchain.
