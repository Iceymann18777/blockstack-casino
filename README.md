A blockchain roulette casino game.

Using a mixture of javascript animations and blockchain frameworks, blockstack casino is a roulette game that saves and records your game history on blockstack distributed data storage. Each time a balance or hi-score is updated, the data gets posted back to the underlying blockchain.

You'll need to authenticate with a blockstack account, an open-source blockchain framework for building decentralized apps and smart contracts, in order to track your score.
